# Event-Registration-App
## Pupose
Built this project to familiarize myself with Django. 
## Project Description
The app allows registered users to create new postings of events or register for existing events.
Events will be listed as postings on the "dashboard" page, with the event name, date, time and description specified.
A many-to-many relationship is used to model users and events in Sqlite.
